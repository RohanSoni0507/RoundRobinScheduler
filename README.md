# RoundRobinScheduler
A C++ program for simulating the Round Robin scheduling algorithm to efficiently manage and execute multiple processes.

# Round Robin Scheduler

## Description

This C++ program simulates the Round Robin scheduling algorithm to efficiently manage and execute multiple processes. It allows you to input process arrival times, burst times, and a time quantum to perform the scheduling and provides detailed results.

## Usage

1. Enter the number of processes.
2. Enter the time quantum for Round Robin (in ms).
3. Input arrival time and burst time for each process.
4. The program will execute the Round Robin scheduling and display the results.

## Results

- Process ID
- Arrival Time
- Burst Time
- Start Time
- Waiting Time
- Finish Time
- Turnaround Time
